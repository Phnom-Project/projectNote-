## CyberSecurity
- ####  Cross-site scripting (xxs)
    cross-site scripting attacks, whereby an 
    attacker injects JavaScript into the pages of your site when users view them. 
    Attackers usually inject malicious JavaScript into dynamic content that 
    comes from a database, from the HTTP request, or from the URI fragment. 
    You can defeat cross-site scripting attacks by escaping any HTML control 
    characters in dynamic content, and by setting a content security policy that 
    prevents the execution of inline JavaScript.
    - **Database** : attacker can insert **(<script></script>)** in field like as **comment sections, search results, and URLs ...** then i will save in database, and when user get these comment, post (that script will execute).
    - **Client browser** : attacker send link with script can execute in user browser when click on it.
- ####  Cross-site Request Forgery Attacks (CRFA)
    Attackers can use web requests from other sites to trick your users into performing undesired actions. 
    The solution to such cross-site request forgery attacks is threefold. 
    - First, make sure your GET requests are side-effect free, so the server state is not changed when a user clicks malicious links.
      ```
      GET/RegisterStudent.asp?user=value1&pass=value2
      ```  
      
      ```
      POST/RegisterStudent.asp HTTP/1.1  
      Host: www.guru99.com
      user=value1&pass=value2
      ```
    - Second, use anti-CSRF cookies to protect other types of requests.
    - Third, set these cookies with a SameSite attribute to strip cookies from requests generated by other sites.   
    > ***For very sensitive actions on your site, itâ€™s a good idea to require the user to reauthenticate themselves when they request to perform these actions. This adds an     additional layer of protection against CSRF attacks, and protects your users if they accidentally leave themselves logged in on shared or stolen devices.***
